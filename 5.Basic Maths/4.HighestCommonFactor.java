/*
Theorem: gcd(a, b) = gcd(b, a % b)

ðŸ”¹ Step by Step Flow

Suppose a = 56, b = 98.

Before loop:
a = 56, b = 98

Iteration 1:

temp = b = 98 (store previous b)

b = a % b = 56 % 98 = 56

a = temp = 98

Now â†’ a = 98, b = 56

Iteration 2:

temp = 56

b = 98 % 56 = 42

a = 56

Now â†’ a = 56, b = 42

Iteration 3:

temp = 42

b = 56 % 42 = 14

a = 42

Now â†’ a = 42, b = 14

Iteration 4:

temp = 14

b = 42 % 14 = 0

a = 14

Now â†’ a = 14, b = 0

ðŸ”¹ Exit Condition

When b = 0, the loop stops, and the current a is the HCF (here 14).

âœ… So to answer your question:

a takes the previous value of b (temp).

b takes the new remainder (a % b).

Thatâ€™s why we need temp â€” to preserve the old b before it gets overwritten.
